Researcher at [Skoltech](https://new.skoltech.ru/en/).

**Research interests.** My main research interests are the development and improvement of generative models. In particular, I am interested in accelerating diffusion models and extending them to unpaired image-to-image translation and use for single cell data.

**Current Research.** My current research is at the intersection of diffusion models and optimal transport theory. I have developed several algorithms and a benchmark for the Schr√∂dinger bridge problem, solving which allows to construct diffusion processes with fast inference time.
